# iteration 23
- bug: When the camera is tilted up or down (any pitch angle), moving the camera horizontally left or right (yaw) induces an unwanted camera tilt in the roll axis (horizon tilts left or right depending on whether looking up or down).
- cause:
  1. Coordinate System Mismatch in Camera Residual:
     - In `init.lua`, the residual camera yaw rotation was constructed around the static local unit vector $(0, 0, 1)$: `quatAxisAngle(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, rYaw)`.
     - In REDengine, `FPPCameraComponent` is an attached component of the player character entity whose parent transform is already pitched by the native camera pitch angle $\theta$ (actuated via `FPPCameraComponent::OnMouseLook` at RVA `0x39CA70`).
     - In a pitched coordinate frame, the local vector $(0, 0, 1)$ is tilted backward (when looking up, $\theta > 0$) or tilted forward (when looking down, $\theta < 0$).
     - Rotating around a tilted Z axis has a projection of $\sin(\theta)$ onto the camera's line of sight (forward vector $\mathbf{F}$).
     - Consequently, applying yaw $rYaw$ around local $(0, 0, 1)$ introduces an unintended roll equal to $\text{Roll} \approx rYaw \cdot \sin(\theta)$. When looking up, moving right causes a rightward roll; when looking down, moving right causes a leftward roll.
- fix:
  1. True World Vertical Axis Projection:
     - Expressed the true gravity up vector $\mathbf{U}_{world} = (0, 0, 1)$ in the camera's local coordinate frame $(\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{U})$.
     - Since $\mathbf{X}_{local} \cdot (0, 0, 1) = 0$, $\mathbf{Y}_{local} \cdot (0, 0, 1) = \sin(\theta) = F_z$, and $\mathbf{Z}_{local} \cdot (0, 0, 1) = \cos(\theta) = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2}$, the true world up axis in camera space is exactly:
       $$\mathbf{V}_{up\_local} = \left(0,\ F_z,\ \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2}\right)$$
     - Dynamically read the camera forward vector $\mathbf{F}$ from `fpp:GetWorldForward()` (with fallback to `DetachedAimSystem.GetCameraForward()`).
     - Constructed residual yaw rotation around the true world vertical axis:
       `quatAxisAngle(0.0, fwdZ, fwdXY, rYaw)`.
     - Mathematically verified in 3D quaternion simulation (`test_math.ps1`) that across all pitch angles ($-45^\circ, -30^\circ, 0^\circ, +30^\circ, +45^\circ, +60^\circ$), camera roll is reduced to strictly **$0.00^\circ$** with zero horizon tilt.
  2. Deployed to `init.lua` in repository and game directory (`E:\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\DetachedReticle\init.lua`).

# iteration 24
- bug: In iteration 23, the gimbal roll tilt was significantly reduced/fixed ("much better now"), but two secondary artifacts appeared during in-game testing:
  1. High-frequency horizontal (left-right) jitters in the camera during active mouse movement.
  2. A slight "shifting" in the camera view after moving and stopping the mouse while the body catches up.
- cause:
  1. Transform Latency & Delayed Scene Graph Feedback Loop:
     - In iteration 23, the world up axis $\mathbf{V}_{up} = (0, F_z, \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2})$ was computed every frame by reading `fpp:GetWorldForward()`.
     - `fpp:GetWorldForward()` queries the child component's transform in world space *after* `fpp:SetLocalTransform` was applied in the previous frame.
     - Scene graph world transforms in REDengine are updated during the render/animation pass with 1-frame latency relative to script `onUpdate`.
     - Furthermore, `fpp:SetLocalTransform(pos, targetRot)` defines the component's orientation in the *parent's* coordinate frame (the puppet head), NOT the child's local frame.
     - Reading the child's forward vector meant that as `rYaw` deflected the camera, `camFwd` changed direction, wobbling the projected rotation axis from frame to frame (causing left-right jitter).
     - When the mouse stopped, as the puppet body caught up and `rYaw` decayed to 0, `camFwd` smoothly shifted back, rotating the parent-space axis and dragging the camera gaze slightly (causing the post-stop shift).
- fix:
  1. Continuous Native Pitch Tracking (Zero Feedback Loop):
     - Recognized that the parent socket's coordinate frame is only pitched by the native camera pitch $\theta_{native}$; it does NOT yaw with `rYaw`.
     - In `InputHook.cpp`, removed periodic pitch zeroing (`s_targetPitch -= s_aimPitch`) so `s_aimPitch` tracks the continuous, absolute native camera pitch angle in degrees without wrapping or drifting.
     - Exposed `DR_ResetChasePitch(initPitch: Float)` to seed the initial pitch angle once upon unholstering.
     - In `init.lua`, computed the parent-space world up axis directly from native pitch:
       ```lua
       local nativePitch = Game.DR_GetAimPitch()
       local pitchRad = math.rad(nativePitch)
       local fwdZ = math.sin(pitchRad)
       local fwdXY = math.cos(pitchRad)
       local qRz = quatAxisAngle(0.0, fwdZ, fwdXY, rYaw)
       ```
     - Completely eliminated all per-frame calls to `fpp:GetWorldForward()` and `aimSys:GetCameraForward()`.
     - During horizontal movement, `nativePitch` is 100% constant, making `(0, fwdZ, fwdXY)` completely rock-solid and impervious to jitter or post-stop shifting.
  2. Re-enabled `Config.debugLogging = true` in `init.lua` for full telemetry verification.
  3. Recompiled `DetachedReticle.dll` and deployed DLL and `init.lua` to game directories.

# iteration 25
- bug: Heavy Machine Gun (HMG) specific issues observed upon unholstering:
  1. Secondary Static Reticle Clutter: Besides the dynamic gun reticle tracking the HMG barrel, an extra static reticle with red "ladder" brackets on the left and right (resembling an aircraft HUD) appears off-center and contributes nothing to gameplay.
  2. Ballistics Decoupling Failure: When firing the HMG, bullets fail to travel to the projected gun reticle, unlike all other guns.
- cause:
  1. HMG Crosshair Hierarchy Architecture:
     - The Militech HMG crosshair widget (`Crosshair_Custom_HMG` in `crosshair_custom_hmg.script` / `crosshair_custom_hmg.inkwidget`) contains both the center crosshair container (`m_crosshairContainer`) and outer pitch ladder / bracket images (`m_leftPartExtra`, `m_rightPartExtra`, `m_overheatContainer`, `m_overheatWarning`).
     - In vanilla, these outer ladder brackets are intended as fixed peripheral HUD elements or overheat gauges; when `DetachedReticle` translates the active crosshair widget, the outer ladder elements either remain detached at static offsets or visually clutter the view without aligning to the reticle.
  2. Projectile Attack vs Hitscan PhysicalRay Pipeline Discrepancy:
     - Unlike standard firearms (rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, LMGs) which use `playerAttack = Attacks.Bullet_GameEffect` (hitscan `gameEffectObjectProvider_PhysicalRay` intercepted by `ShootingHook.cpp`), TweakDB assigns the HMG (`Preset_HMG_Default`) `rangedAttacks = Attacks.ExplodingBulletHMGPackage`.
     - In `bullets.tweak`, `Attacks.ExplodingBulletHMG` defines `playerAttack = Attacks.ExplodingBulletSmallProjectile` (a `Bullet_Projectile` launched via native projectile spawner at 140 m/s towards the camera look target).
     - Because `Attacks.ExplodingBulletSmallProjectile` bypasses `gameEffectObjectProvider_PhysicalRay`, `ShootingHook.cpp` is never invoked, causing HMG shots to launch along the camera vector rather than the physical muzzle orientation.
- fix:
  1. Clean Up HMG Crosshair HUD:
     - In `r6/scripts/DetachedReticle/DetachedReticle.reds`, wrapped `Crosshair_Custom_HMG`'s lifecycle methods (`OnInitialize`, `OnPreIntro`, `OnBulletSpreadChanged`, `OnOverheatChanged`).
     - Added `DR_HideLadderWidgets()` to set `m_leftPartExtra`, `m_rightPartExtra`, `m_overheatContainer`, and `m_overheatWarning` to invisible (`SetVisible(false)`) and transparent (`SetOpacity(0.0)`).
     - Added a recursive pass on `GetRootCompoundWidget()` to ensure any direct static ladder / HUD child elements are hidden, while leaving `m_crosshairContainer` cleanly tracking the weapon barrel.
  2. Unified Ballistics Redirection for HMG:
     - In `r6/scripts/DetachedReticle/DetachedReticle.reds`, wrapped `WeaponTransition.GetDesiredAttackRecord`:
       ```swift
       @wrapMethod(WeaponTransition)
       protected func GetDesiredAttackRecord(stateContext: ref<StateContext>, scriptInterface: ref<StateGameScriptInterface>) -> ref<Attack_Record> {
           let weapon: ref<WeaponObject> = this.GetWeaponObject(scriptInterface);
           if IsDefined(weapon) && (weapon.IsHeavyWeapon() || WeaponObject.GetWeaponType(weapon.GetItemID()) == gamedataItemType.Wea_HeavyMachineGun) {
               let hmgAttack: ref<Attack_Record> = TweakDBInterface.GetAttackRecord(t"Attacks.ExplodingBulletMediumEffect");
               if IsDefined(hmgAttack) {
                   return hmgAttack;
               }
           }
           return wrappedMethod(stateContext, scriptInterface);
       }
       ```
     - In `ShootEvents.OnEnter`, re-asserted `weapon.SetAttack(t"Attacks.ExplodingBulletMediumEffect")` immediately after `wrappedMethod(...)`.
     - In `r6/tweaks/DetachedReticle/hmg_attack.yaml`, configured TweakXL to map `Attacks.ExplodingBulletHMG.playerAttack: Attacks.ExplodingBulletMediumEffect`.
     - `Attacks.ExplodingBulletMediumEffect` is a vanilla `Bullet_GameEffect` with identical damage multipliers (0.5x physical, thermal, chemical, electric) and explosive payload (`Attacks.BulletMediumExplosion`). This routes HMG fire through `gameEffectObjectProvider_PhysicalRay`, allowing `ShootingHook.cpp` to redirect bullets precisely from the physical muzzle to the projected gun reticle.
     - Resolved startup compilation error (`[NO_MATCHING_OVERLOAD]` on `OperatorEqual`) by converting enum comparisons to standard redscript `EnumInt(...) == EnumInt(...)`.
  3. Deployed updated `DetachedReticle.reds` and `hmg_attack.yaml` to `E:\Cyberpunk 2077`.

# iteration 26
- error: 
    ```
    [ERROR] [NO_MATCHING_OVERLOAD] At DetachedReticle.reds:475 & 485:
    arguments passed to 'OperatorEqual' do not match any of the overloads:
    1st argument: expected 'TweakDBID', given 'gamedataItemType'
    ```
- cause: In redscript, enum types (such as gamedataItemType) do not expose a direct global == operator overload within class modules. Comparing them directly via == causes [NO_MATCHING_OVERLOAD]. In redscript, enum comparison must be performed via integer representation using EnumInt(...) == EnumInt(...).
- fix:
    - Resolved startup compilation error (`[NO_MATCHING_OVERLOAD]` on `OperatorEqual`) by converting enum comparisons to standard redscript `EnumInt(...) == EnumInt(...)`.
    ``` swift
        if IsDefined(weapon) && (weapon.IsHeavyWeapon() || EnumInt(WeaponObject.GetWeaponType(weapon.GetItemID())) == EnumInt(gamedataItemType.Wea_HeavyMachineGun)) {
               let hmgAttack: ref<Attack_Record> = TweakDBInterface.GetAttackRecord(t"Attacks.ExplodingBulletMediumEffect");
               if IsDefined(hmgAttack) {
                   return hmgAttack;
               }
           }

# iteration 27
- bug:
  1. HMG Ballistics confirmed 100% resolved by user test in Iteration 26 ("The bullet from HMG already goes towards the gun reticle correctly now.").
  2. The previous `DR_HideLadderWidgets()` attempt in Iteration 25/26 targeted the wrong elements (`m_leftPartExtra`, `m_rightPartExtra`, `m_overheatContainer`), which did not affect the zoom indicator.
  3. User requirement clarification: Do NOT hide the zoom indicator element; instead, center it at screen center `(0, 0)` whenever it is visible. When the weapon is holstered, holding right-click already displays the zoom reticle centered at `(0, 0)`; the off-center issue only manifests when holding an HMG.
- cause:
  1. In `UpdateDetachedAim()`, when unarmed/holstered (`!IsDefined(weapon)`), `activeWidget.SetTranslation(new Vector2(0.0, 0.0))` is called. When right-click is held while unarmed, optical zoom (`CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon`) is active and remains centered at `(0, 0)`.
  2. When an HMG is equipped, `weapon` is defined, so `UpdateDetachedAim()` executes `activeWidget.SetTranslation(screenOffset)` to track the physical weapon barrel.
  3. Because an HMG cannot aim down sights (ADS) via weapon optics, holding right-click activates optical eye zoom. If `activeWidget` is translated by `screenOffset`, any zoom elements inside it (e.g. `fluff`) or any active zoom crosshair widget inherits `screenOffset`, displacing the zoom indicator away from the camera gaze to the gun barrel's physical orientation.
- fix:
  1. Deleted `DR_HideLadderWidgets()` and removed all widget hiding from `Crosshair_Custom_HMG` so vanilla UI elements are fully preserved.
  2. Implemented Multi-Layer Zoom Centering in `UpdateDetachedAim()`:
     - Active Controller Check: If `activeController` is `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon`, forces `activeWidget.SetTranslation(new Vector2(0.0, 0.0))` so optical zoom remains locked to camera gaze.
     - Weapon Crosshair & Counter-Translation: When `activeWidget` is the weapon reticle (`screenOffset`), inspects if child `fluff` exists. If `fluff` is visible, counter-translates it by `-screenOffset` (`fluff.SetTranslation(new Vector2(-screenOffset.X, -screenOffset.Y))`) so its effective screen position is `screenOffset + (-screenOffset) = (0, 0)`.
     - Secondary Widget Centering: Iterates all direct children in `this.m_rootWidget`. Any visible child other than `activeWidget` and `m_cameraCrosshair` is forced to `SetTranslation(new Vector2(0.0, 0.0))`.
  3. Root Centering in `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon`:
     - Wrapped `OnInitialize`, `OnState_Aim`, `OnState_HipFire`, and `OnZoomLevel` on `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon` to enforce `rootWidget.SetTranslation(new Vector2(0.0, 0.0))`.
  4. Comprehensive Multi-Method Diagnostic Probes:
     - Added recursive 3-level widget hierarchy dumper on `Crosshair_Custom_HMG` (`DR_LogHmgHierarchy`) logging names, classes, visibility, sizes, translations, and margins for all children and grandchildren.
     - Added telemetry dumper in `UpdateDetachedAim()` logging `activeWidget`, `activeController`, blackboard crosshair state, and zoom level.
     - Wrapped `scannerBorderGameController.OnScannerZoom` and `hud_turret.OnScannerZoom` to detect any secondary zoom HUD activations.
  5. Deployed updated `DetachedReticle.reds` to `E:\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts\DetachedReticle\DetachedReticle.reds`.

# iteration 28
- error:
    ```
    [ERROR] [UNRESOLVED_METHOD] At DetachedReticle.reds:609:1:
    @wrapMethod(CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon)
    no method with this name exists on the target type (OnInitialize)

    [ERROR] [UNRESOLVED_REF] At DetachedReticle.reds:651:1:
    @wrapMethod(hud_turret)
    unresolved reference 'hud_turret'
    ```
- cause:
    1. In vanilla scripts, `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon` does not directly declare or override `OnInitialize()` (it is inherited from `gameuiCrosshairBaseGameController`). In redscript, `@wrapMethod` on a subclass requires the target method to be explicitly defined on that exact class; attempting to wrap an inherited method produces `[UNRESOLVED_METHOD]`.
    2. `hud_turret` is a specialized HUD class not recognized in the core global symbol table during redscript startup compilation, generating `[UNRESOLVED_REF]`.
- fix:
    1. In `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon`, replaced `@wrapMethod` of `OnInitialize` with `OnPlayerAttach(playerPuppet: ref<GameObject>) -> Bool`, which is directly defined on `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon`.
    2. Removed the unnecessary speculative wrapper blocks for `hud_turret` and `scannerBorderGameController`, maintaining focused hooks on `CrosshairGameController_NoWeapon`, `Crosshair_Custom_HMG`, and `gameuiCrosshairContainerController`.
    3. Deployed the updated `DetachedReticle.reds` to `E:\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\scripts\DetachedReticle\DetachedReticle.reds`.
